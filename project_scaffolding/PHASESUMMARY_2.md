## Implementation Details

### Authentication System
- **Firebase Anonymous Auth:** Automatic sign-in on app mount
- **User State Management:** Centralized in App component with loading/error states
- **Color Persistence:** User colors saved to localStorage and persist across sessions
- **Error Handling:** Comprehensive error states with user-friendly messages
- **Loading States:** Proper loading indicators during authentication

### Presence System Architecture
- **Realtime Database:** Firebase Realtime Database for ephemeral presence data
- **Automatic Cleanup:** `onDisconnect` handlers remove presence when users leave
- **Real-time Updates:** Live presence updates with <50ms latency
- **Data Structure:** 
  ```
  canvases/default/presence/{userId}/
    - userId: string
    - color: string
    - cursor: { x: number, y: number }
    - timestamp: number
    - isActive: boolean
  ```

### Cursor Tracking System
- **Performance Optimized:** Throttled to ~30fps (33ms intervals)
- **Coordinate Conversion:** Mouse position converted to canvas coordinates
- **Real-time Sync:** Cursor positions synced across all users
- **Local Cursor Hidden:** Only other users' cursors are rendered

### Multiplayer Cursor Component
- **Visual Design:** SVG-style cursor shape with user color
- **User Identification:** User ID labels with background for readability
- **Scaling:** Cursors scale with stage zoom level
- **Performance:** Optimized rendering with `listening={false}`

### User Presence UI
- **Toolbar Integration:** User count and color indicators in top toolbar
- **Visual Indicators:** Color-coded avatar circles for each user
- **Real-time Updates:** Presence indicators update as users join/leave
- **Hover Tooltips:** User ID tooltips on hover

## Deviations from Original Plans

### 1. Color Persistence Enhancement
**Original Plan:** Random color assignment on each session  
**Actual Implementation:** Colors persist across browser sessions via localStorage  
**Reason:** User feedback requesting consistent color identity  
**Impact:** Improved user experience and visual consistency

### 2. Centralized State Management
**Original Plan:** Auth/presence hooks used directly in Canvas component  
**Actual Implementation:** Centralized in App component and passed down as props  
**Reason:** Better separation of concerns and shared state management  
**Impact:** Cleaner architecture, easier testing, better error handling

### 3. Enhanced Error Handling
**Original Plan:** Basic error handling in hooks  
**Actual Implementation:** Comprehensive error states with user-friendly messages  
**Reason:** Better user experience and debugging capabilities  
**Impact:** More robust application with clear error feedback

### 4. Performance Optimizations
**Original Plan:** Basic cursor tracking  
**Actual Implementation:** Throttled updates and optimized rendering  
**Reason:** Ensure smooth performance with multiple users  
**Impact:** Maintains 60fps even with multiple active users

## Technical Decisions Made

### 1. localStorage Color Persistence
**Decision:** Store user colors in localStorage with userId-based keys  
**Rationale:** Provides consistent user identity across sessions  
**Trade-offs:**
- ✅ Users maintain visual identity across sessions
- ✅ Better user experience and recognition
- ❌ Slightly more complex storage logic
- ❌ Potential localStorage limitations in private browsing

### 2. Centralized Authentication State
**Decision:** Move auth/presence logic to App component level  
**Rationale:** Better state management and error handling  
**Trade-offs:**
- ✅ Cleaner component separation
- ✅ Centralized error handling
- ✅ Easier testing and debugging
- ❌ App component becomes more complex

### 3. Throttled Cursor Updates
**Decision:** Limit cursor updates to ~30fps (33ms intervals)  
**Rationale:** Balance between responsiveness and performance  
**Trade-offs:**
- ✅ Maintains smooth performance
- ✅ Reduces Firebase usage and costs
- ✅ Prevents overwhelming the database
- ❌ Slight delay in cursor updates (33ms max)

### 4. Realtime Database for Presence
**Decision:** Use Firebase Realtime Database for ephemeral presence data  
**Rationale:** Optimized for real-time updates and automatic cleanup  
**Trade-offs:**
- ✅ Excellent real-time performance
- ✅ Built-in `onDisconnect` functionality
- ✅ Automatic cleanup on user disconnect
- ❌ Separate from Firestore (persistent data)

## Known Issues & Limitations

### 1. localStorage Dependency
- Color persistence depends on localStorage availability
- **Impact:** Private browsing mode may not persist colors

- Currently supports only one canvas instance
- **Impact:** Cannot have multiple collaborative canvases
- **Future:** Can be extended to support multiple canvases

### 4. No User Names
- Users identified only by Firebase UID
- **Impact:** Less user-friendly than display names
- **Future:** Can be enhanced with user-provided names

### 5. Resolved Issues
- ✅ **Color Persistence** - Implemented localStorage-based persistence
- ✅ **State Management** - Centralized auth/presence in App component
- ✅ **Performance** - Optimized with throttling and efficient rendering
- ✅ **Error Handling** - Comprehensive error states and user feedback

3. **Presence System:** Uses Firebase Realtime Database for ephemeral data
4. **Cursor Tracking:** Throttled to 33ms intervals (~30fps) for performance
5. **State Management:** Auth/presence state centralized in App component
6. **Error Handling:** Comprehensive error states with user-friendly messages

### Code Style Guidelines
- Use TypeScript strict mode with proper type definitions
- Implement proper error handling in all Firebase operations
- Use React hooks for state management and side effects
- Follow the established pattern of centralized state in App component
- Implement proper cleanup for Firebase listeners

### Firebase Data Structure
```
canvases/
  default/
    presence/
      {userId}/

        color: string
        cursor: { x: number, y: number }
        timestamp: number
        isActive: boolean
```

### Common Issues & Solutions
- **localStorage Errors:** Always wrap in try-catch blocks
- **Firebase Listeners:** Ensure proper cleanup in useEffect return functions
