## Technical Implementation Details

### Object Locking System Architecture
```typescript
// Lock management interface
interface Lock {
  userId: string;
  timestamp: number;
  shapeId: string;
}

// Lock operations
const useLocks = (canvasId: string, currentUserId: string | null) => {
  const acquireLock = async (shapeId: string): Promise<boolean>
  const releaseLock = async (shapeId: string): Promise<boolean>
  const isLocked = (shapeId: string): boolean
  const isLockedByCurrentUser = (shapeId: string): boolean
  const getCurrentUserLock = (): string | null
}
```

**Data Structure:**
```
canvases/{canvasId}/locks/{shapeId}/
  - userId: string
  - timestamp: number
  - shapeId: string
```

### Error Handling Architecture
```typescript
// Custom error classes
export class CanvasServiceError extends Error {
  public code?: string;
  public originalError?: any;
}

export class ShapeServiceError extends Error {
  public code?: string;
  public originalError?: any;
}

export class ShapeValidationError extends Error {
  public code?: string;
  public originalError?: any;
}
```

### Loading State Management
